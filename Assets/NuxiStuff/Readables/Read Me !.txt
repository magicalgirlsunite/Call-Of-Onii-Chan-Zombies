This document is for V1.0 of the script. Future updates may make changes to this process.

[========================================HOW TO SET UP=========================================]

[Easy Method]

1 - Create an Empty Object in your heirarchy.
2 - Attach the "DashAndDoubleJump" script to the Empty Object.
3 - You can now dash and double jump!

[Easier Method]

1 - Drag the included prefab into your heirarchy.

[=========================================HOW IT WORKS=========================================]

[---------------------------------------------DASH---------------------------------------------]

[Description]

You can dash by double tapping forward quickly whilst airborne. This should send you forward 
at quick velocity for a short time and play a dash sfx (not included). Once you dash, a 
cool-down timer for the ability begins. Once that cool-down is completed, it plays a dash 
ready sfx (also not included).

[Variables]

1 - Dash Speed controls how fast you move forward while dashing.
2 - Dash Duration controls how long the dash lasts.
3 - Dash Cooldown Time controls how long the cooldown lasts before you can dash again.
4 - Dash Double Tap Threshold controls the amount of time between inputs to initiate the dash.
5 - Dash Audio Source plays when the dash ability is used.
6 - Dash Ready Audio Source plays when the cooldown period has ended.

[-----------------------------------------DOUBLE JUMP------------------------------------------]

[Description]

You can double jump by tapping jump twice. Once on the ground and again while airborne. The 
script detects if the player is grounded before resetting max jumps variable to zero. Jumping
will play a jump sfx (not included).

[Variables]

1 - Jump Force controls how strong jumps are.
2 - Max Jumps controls how many jumps a player gets before needing to land to jump again.
3 - Jump Audio Source plays each time the player jumps.
